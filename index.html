        The Mysore Palace is one of the major attractions in Mysore.This is the official residence of the royal family of Mysore -The Wodeyars. The Palace has four entrances but the public is allowed only from the west (Varaha) gate.The Palace is beautiful from inside and the rooms which are open for public viewing serves as museum with many old and beautiful royal paintings that adorn the wall giving out details on the royal culture and traditions ,royal outfits, traditional weapons like tiger’s claw, king`s throne ,expensive and rare furniture,beautiful chandeliers to name a few.The pillars and ceilings inside the palace have beautiful engravings on them.Taking photos inside the palace is prohibited but even from outside ,the palace looks majestic and photogenic.There is a garden surrounding the palace which enhances its beauty. There is a nominal entry fee of Rs 20 for Indian visitors ,kids below 10 years can go in for free but for foreigners it is Rs 200 (seems unfair though)
The Palace is lit up with beautiful lights on Sunday evening and public holidays from 7:00 PM to 7:45 PM . It`s creates a beautiful view. Dussehra is celebrated in a grand way here,lots of cultural programs are being held and the palace is decorated like a new bride but the only disadvantage is that the palace is too crowded that time. A must see Palace.

    <p>To cut a long story short, this “magnum opus” is a CGI laden attempt to blend the good old folk lore format into a kitschy hero-worshipping Tollywood potboiler. A romantic sequence in which Sivudu woos Avanthika (Tamannaah) emphatically proves why. A brief background about Avanthika first: a feared warrior from the fiefdom of Kuntala, she’s dedicated her life to the cause of rescuing Devasena (Anushka), the wife of Amarendra Bahubali and mother of Sivudu, from the clutches of the vicious Bhallaladeva, the backbiting first cousin of Bahubali who usurps the throne. Cut to the scene. “Nuvvu oka aada pillavi. Nenu oka mogadini. Nenu aa neeti konda ni ekki vachcha nini premisthuna ani cheppadaniki," (You are a girl, I'm a man, who has climbed up this mountain, to say I love you), quips Prabhas, even as Avanthika has her sword pointed at his heart. For the next couple of minutes, a fight ensues during the course of which he skillfully disrobes her right down to her (very fashionable) red inner wear, and leaves a splattering of his blood on her forehead. seeing her own reflection in a sheath of water cascading from a cliff, Tamannah realises that he is her man and jumps to embrace him. Then they make love over a song.</p>

    <p>Before you read what the story is all about, trust me, it’ll sound like an ordinary ‘brutal Brits VS ingenious Indians’ story, in which a White family abducts a kid Mali because why not? They have always been doing this, and what always has been done is also taking revenge on them but trust me it hasn’t been as grand as this. So, now you know the basic outline of the story, the kid that’s abducted from the poor Indian family is protected by Bheem (Jr NTR), as the film states there’s a herdsman for every group and the Brits choose the wrong one to mess with.

      Bheem clashes with Ram (Ram Charan) and grows to be his BFF without knowing that he’s working for British Government. Ram is that kind of officer, who works even on the weekend just to keep his boss happy, but internally even he wants only thing ‘revenge’ because why else would an Indian earn such a high rank in the British force? Though Ram is a frustrated employee of the company, he builds a play to earn their trust and for that, he does some pretty nasty things to Bheem. Bheem wants Mali, Ram wants revenge & you’d want to take a breath to process what happened in the last 3 hours of your life.</p>
